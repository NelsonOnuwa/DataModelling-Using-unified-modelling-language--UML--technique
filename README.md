Unified modeling language (UML)



Unified modeling language is a general-purpose modeling language that defines a standard that visualizes the design of a system. 
It enhances understanding with graphical notations and symbols. It helps businesses, software engineers and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis. 
Business people do not understand coding, so unified modeling language (UML) becomes essential to communicate with nonprogrammers, the functionalities, the essential requirements and the processes of the system. 
Diagrams in Unified modeling language can be either structural or behavioral. 


Structure diagrams helps one to see the static view of the system in terms of its components.
Behavioral diagrams show how the system and its component behave over time and what should happen in a system. 
They describe how the objects interact with each other to create a functioning system. Structural diagrams include the component, the deployment object and the class diagrams. 
The class diagram is a structural diagram and it shows a static view of all the classes created while the component diagram shows the relationship between different components in a system. 
The behavioral diagrams include state, use case, and activity diagrams.
The use case diagram represents the relationship between actors (end-user) and the functions within a software or system while the activity diagram is a behavioral diagram that show cases the systemâ€™s logical workflow.




Dealing with multiple objects in a system may be a source of challenges in learning the establishment of relationships between various attributes and objects in the system. 
A class diagram (my choice for the representation of the transport system in Wales) helps provide a particular visual representation with less confusion. 
A class diagram helps in illustrating the data models accurately, regardless of the complexity involved with the classes and data. 
It provides an easy and clear understanding of the overview and the detailed schematics within the system or the processes. 
A class diagram prepares a visual representation of the needs and requirements for the system. It also renders the creation of better detailing by utilizing charts for better results in understanding the prospects involved in the system. 
It also makes decisions on the particular implementation procedures required in the systems for better outcomes. 
Hence, a class diagram is one of the mostly used Unified modeling language (UML) diagrams.
